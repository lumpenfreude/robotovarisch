## ROBO-TOVARISCH

a friendly comrade bot for [matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org)

very much still in-progress, but currently usable as heck. 

features:
* per-channel greetings and rules lists (stored in postgresql)
* a "semi-public" list of rooms (i.e. not listed publicly on the server, but publicly joinable, and listed via the bot) (WIP)
* dice rolling, because of course you gotta have dice rolling
* bonk people who are being too horny with !comrade bonk
* comfort comrades in need of comfort with !comrade comfort
* more to come! please ask for features or whatever the heck

based on [matrix-nio](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/) and [nio-template](https://github.com/anoadragon453/nio-template)
